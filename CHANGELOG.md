# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-27)

First release.

- **The map:** an interactive node graph of a codebase, from the whole app down to single files and endpoints. Every part has a plain-English name and description. It works across several repos side by side.
- **Connections:** imports, and web requests matched to the server endpoints they reach, including URLs built in variables, nested template strings and small request helpers. Flask blueprint and Express router prefixes are resolved, nested mounts included.
- **Screens:** detects an app's pages (Next.js, React Router, Vue, SvelteKit, Remix, Nuxt, Astro, Expo, Angular, TanStack) and shows everything behind each one.
- **Health check:** passwords and keys in code, endpoints anyone can use without signing in, unused files and very large files, each with a ready-made fix prompt. Secret values are never stored.
- **Ask:** questions answered as a mini-map with a walkthrough, through the Claude Code CLI or the Claude app.
- **Flows:** guided walkthroughs, plus "Request a new flow".
- **Start here** tour, plain-language glossary and a "Show technical detail" switch.
- **Recent work:** the cards Claude just changed are highlighted, each with a note tying the change to what was asked.
- **Updates:** refreshes re-read only what changed, and an open map reloads itself.
- **Git:** nothing Floorplan creates is committed. The map folder ignores itself, and Claude's notes go in `CLAUDE.local.md`.
